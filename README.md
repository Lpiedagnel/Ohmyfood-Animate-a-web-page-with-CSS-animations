# Ohmyfood: Animate a web page with CSS animations

This is a student project for OpenClassrooms. The goal is to use HTML and CSS animations to match (as close as possible) the mockup we are given.

Warning: this is NOT an official correction by OpenClassrooms. This repo is only my work as a student.
